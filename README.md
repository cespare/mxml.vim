mxml.vim
========

This was copied from [mxml.vim](http://abdulqabiz.com/files/vim/mxml.vim) over
[here](http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/). I made
a quick and dirty hack to fix the actionscript highlighting in `CDATA` sections.

Note: This will only work if you already have actionscript highlighting. There is an acceptable syntax file
for actionscript located on the aforementioned page as well.
